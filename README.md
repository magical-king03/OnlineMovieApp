This web application is designed to retrieve and display movie details from the OMDB API. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project serves as an initial step in my journey to enhance my web development skills. While the current version of the website is not responsive, it effectively demonstrates my understanding of basic web technologies and API integration. This project represents one of my first forays into practical web development, providing a solid foundation for more advanced and responsive applications in the future.
